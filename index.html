                    <h2>Why Tehran?</h2>
                    <h3>Tehran is the capital and largest city of Iran and the largest city in Tehran Province</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tehran is the capital of Iran, in the north of the country. Its central Golestan Palace complex,
                        with its ornate rooms
                        and marble throne, was the seat of power of the Qajar dynasty. The National Jewelry Museum holds
                        many of the Qajar
                        monarchs’ jewels, while the National Museum of Iran has artifacts dating back to Paleolithic
                        times. The Milad Tower
                        offers panoramic views over the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty in
                        1786, because of its
                        proximity to Iran's territories in the Caucasus, then separated from Iran in the Russo-Iranian
                        Wars, to avoid the vying
                        factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties. The capital has been moved several times
                        throughout history,
                        however, and Tehran became the 32nd capital of Persia. Large-scale construction works began in
                        the 1920s, and Tehran
                        became a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century.</p>
                    <p class="di">
                        Tehran is home to many historical sites, including the royal complexes of Golestan, Sa'dabad,
                        and Niavaran, where the
                        last two dynasties of the former Imperial State of Iran were seated. Tehran's landmarks include
                        the Azadi Tower, a
                        memorial built under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1971 to mark the
                        2,500th anniversary of
                        the Persian Empire, the Milad Tower, the world's sixth-tallest self-supporting tower, completed
                        in 2007, and the Tabiat
                        Bridge, completed in 2014.

                                Their waiters are so friendly. we always use this cafe for our evening. just they should
                                train their staffs to reach
                                professional targets. prices are budget friendly. i prefer to use the table No. 11 in
                                the balcony. it has a good view to
                                the small park in downtown. totally i can suggest to you especially at evening and
